Took the Geoguessr page from yesterday and adapted it by adding animations and transitions.

Added 2 animations:
(1) Make the earth image shake on page load and mouse-over.
(2) Make the intro text fade-in on page load.

Added 2 transitions:
(1) Change the card background color on mouse-over.
(2) In the header, change the background color and also increase the font-size on mouse-over. Increasing the font-size also has the effect of enlarging the header.
