Took the Geoguessr page from yesterday and adapted it by adding animations and transitions.

Added 2 annimations:
(1) Make the earth shake on page load and mouse-over
(2) Make the intro text fade-in on page load

Added 2 transitions:
(1) Change card background color on mouse-over
(2) Change the font-size of the header (and thus the size of the header) on mouse-over
