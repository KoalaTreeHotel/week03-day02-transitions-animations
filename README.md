Week 2: Day 3 - Challenge:

I would like you to put together some of your own Animation and Transition examples, in order for you to experiment with the different properties and familiarise yourselves with them. I would like a minimum of 2 animations and 2 transitions.

If you manage to complete the challenge, I would like you to start putting some plans together ahead of tomorrow. As tomorrow you will be given the session to work on a HTML and CSS landing page.

The landing page can be on a subject of your choosing whether that be a personal project such as your portfolio or for a made up business of some kind. I want you to think about which elements should be used where, as well as making sure that the website styled appropriately.

If you have any questions or require any assistance at all, please do not hesitate to reach out.
